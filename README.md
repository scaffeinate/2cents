One night hack for Hack_UTD. Here is the submission to ChallengePost http://challengepost.com/software/twocents. Built with Ruby on Rails 4 & Twitter Bootstrap

When I first moved to Dallas, I found it really hard to find places for groceries, good food and other everyday stuff. As days passed, I got to know about such things through word of mouth from my friends and others who have been living there. That is when I thought of an app that would help the users find the best things from their neighborhood like the best food, best place to get milk, best place to hangout on a Friday evening and the likes. That is the motivation behind the application. The target user of this application is everybody who wants to know the tips and tricks of their neighborhood - this app will especially be helpful for people moving to a new location by showing the tips for that location which have been posted by the people of that locality.
